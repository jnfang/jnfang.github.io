<img src="/images/projects_fulls/habits.png" class="fit image"> In the summer of 2013, I spent three months working at Jana Care, a medical device startup, in Bangalore, India. They were working on a web and Android app called Habits for diabetics to track their glucose levels, food intake, and exercise. This was my first technical internship. I owned several projects both on the main Python application and on the Android app. A brief description of each project in chronological order is below. Much of the code is proprietary but I have included some code for a plugin I created that became open sourced.  
Tools: *Django, Python, jQuery, JavaScript, Android*

1. Spell checker of food input - On the web app, as user typed in their food item, a real-time prediction dropdown would show possible foods, by order of most to least likely in terms of number of swaps. 
2. Plugin to enable client side cropping - Used HTML5 Canvas to create a jQuery plugin that enables cropping of a pic on the client side, so that a large image does not have to be sent to the server or stored on it. Complete [code on GitHub]
3. Encryption and Decryption - Encryption on the Python web app and decryption on the Android app
4. Prototype Android app - Modified ODK Collect to create Android app for community health workers to triage diabetes and iron deficiency patients. I worked with one other intern on this and followed the protocol as prescribed by the Public Health Foundation of India.
